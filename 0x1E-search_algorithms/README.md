# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms
## Description
    This project is about search algortihms in C
## Requirements
    All the files were compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using GCC 4.8.4 with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic flags
## Content
| File | Description |

| [0-linear.c](./0-linear.c) |  function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm |
| [1-binary.c](./1-binary.c) | function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm |
| [search_algos.h](./search_algos.h) | Header file |
| [2-O](./2-O) | time complexity (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size n |
| [3-O](./3-O) | space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n |
| [4-O](./4-O) | time complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n |
| [5-O](./5-O) | space complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n |
| [6-O](./6-O) | space complexity for a specific function |
